Random Password Generator

Overview  
This project is a *Random Password Generator* written in Python. It generates secure passwords based on user-specified lengths and follows a *50-30-20 formula* for character distribution:  
•	0% alphabets (uppercase and lowercase)
•	30% numbers  
•	20% special characters

Features 
•	Allows the user to specify the desired password length.  
•	Randomizes the order of characters for added security.  
•	Uses uppercase and lowercase letters for better complexity.  
•	Ensures strong password creation with numbers and special characters.  

How It Works
1. The user inputs the desired password length.  
2. The password is split into *alphabets, **numbers, and **special characters* based on the *50-30-20 rule*.  
3. Characters are randomly selected from predefined sets.  
4. The final password is shuffled and displayed.  

Example Usage  
bash
Enter Password Length: 12
Generated Password: aB3g@1H9%jQ2
